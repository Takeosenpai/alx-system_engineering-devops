## Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

### Issue Summary:

- **Duration:** February 17, 2024, 10:00 PM - February 18, 2024, 3:00 AM (UTC)
- **Impact:** The user authentication service experienced a complete outage for approximately 5 hours, affecting 80% of users. Users were unable to log in, leading to frustration and disruption of service.
- **Root Cause:** A misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to excessive traffic redirection to a single authentication server, causing it to become overwhelmed and unresponsive.

### Timeline:

- **February 17, 2024, 10:30 PM (UTC):** Issue detected by monitoring alerts indicating a spike in server errors.
- **February 17, 2024, 10:35 PM (UTC):** Engineering team alerted to investigate the issue.
- **February 17, 2024, 10:45 PM (UTC):** Assumed initial root cause to be database overload due to increased traffic.
- **February 17, 2024, 11:00 PM (UTC):** Database performance analyzed, found to be within normal parameters.
- **February 17, 2024, 11:30 PM (UTC):** Load balancer configuration checked, revealing misconfiguration causing uneven distribution of traffic.
- **February 17, 2024, 11:45 PM (UTC):** Incident escalated to senior engineering team for further assistance.
- **February 18, 2024, 1:00 AM (UTC):** Load balancer settings adjusted to evenly distribute traffic among authentication servers.
- **February 18, 2024, 2:00 AM (UTC):** Services gradually restored, and user authentication functionality resumed.
- **February 18, 2024, 3:00 AM (UTC):** Full service recovery confirmed.

### Root Cause and Resolution:

- **Root Cause:** Misconfigured load balancer led to uneven distribution of traffic, overwhelming a single authentication server.
- **Resolution:** Load balancer settings were adjusted to evenly distribute traffic across all available authentication servers, restoring service functionality.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Regular auditing of load balancer configurations to ensure proper traffic distribution.
  - Implementation of automated alerts for abnormal traffic patterns to detect similar issues promptly.
  - Enhanced load testing procedures to identify potential configuration weaknesses before deployment.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Conduct thorough review and documentation of load balancer configurations.
  - Implement automated tests to verify load balancer functionality during configuration changes.
  - Schedule regular load testing exercises to evaluate system performance under varying traffic conditions.
  - Provide additional training for operations team members on load balancer management and troubleshooting techniques.

By implementing these corrective measures and diligently addressing the root cause of this incident, we aim to strengthen the reliability and resilience of our web stack infrastructure, ensuring uninterrupted service for our users in the future.

## Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident - Learning from the Chaos

### Issue Summary:

- **Duration:** February 17, 2024, 10:00 PM - February 18, 2024, 3:00 AM (UTC)
- **Impact:** Picture this: our user authentication service decided to take a nap for 5 hours straight, leaving 80% of our users locked out like they forgot their keys at a party. Chaos ensued.
- **Root Cause:** It turns out our load balancer fancied playing favorites, directing all the traffic to one poor authentication server until it threw its hands up in despair and went on strike.

### Timeline:

- **February 17, 2024, 10:30 PM (UTC):** Monitoring alerts started screaming bloody murder about server errors.
- **February 17, 2024, 10:35 PM (UTC):** Engineers were rudely awakened from their Netflix binge to address the crisis.
- **February 17, 2024, 11:00 PM (UTC):** We blamed the database for the mess, but it turned out to be innocent. Sorry, database, it wasn't you.
- **February 17, 2024, 11:30 PM (UTC):** A Sherlock Holmes moment occurred, revealing the load balancer as the culprit.
- **February 17, 2024, 11:45 PM (UTC):** We called in the big guns, aka senior engineering team, for backup.
- **February 18, 2024, 1:00 AM (UTC):** Load balancer settings were adjusted, and peace was restored to the realm.
- **February 18, 2024, 3:00 AM (UTC):** Victory was declared as services were back in action, and users rejoiced.

### Root Cause and Resolution:

- **Root Cause:** Our mischievous load balancer decided to play a cruel game of "Let's overload one server and watch it squirm."
- **Resolution:** We put the load balancer in timeout and adjusted its settings to share the workload evenly among all servers. Problem solved!

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Added load balancer configuration checks to our morning routine to prevent further shenanigans.
  - Installed a "Traffic Fairness" button on the load balancer dashboard - no more playing favorites!
  - Scheduled a team-building workshop for our servers to promote better cooperation and workload sharing.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Conducted load balancer configuration review and documented it with glitter pens for extra flair.
  - Implemented automated tests to ensure the load balancer behaves itself during traffic spikes.
  - Organized a load testing party (with pizza) to simulate different scenarios and strengthen our defenses.
  - Started a support group for stressed-out servers to vent their frustrations and share coping mechanisms.

### Conclusion:

While we can't promise that our systems won't have the occasional meltdown, we're committed to learning from our mistakes and making our infrastructure more resilient. Remember, even in the midst of chaos, there's always room for a little laughter and a lot of improvement. Stay tuned for more adventures in the world of web stack wizardry!
